# Todo

## Subject Block 
- `player` should know what the `currentTile` is based on its x and y coordinates. 

- `subjectTile` should be determinded based on `player`'s `xfacing` and `yfacing` combined 

- `subjectTile` should highlight with an off-colored outline. 

- As `player` navigates, `subjectTile` should change based on `player`'s position and direction facing

- - - 

## Map Navigation 
- Game should have many `tileMaps` and when the player reaches the edge of the `tileMap`... they should be navigated to the next. 

- Maps could be held in a higher 2D Array which are navigated based on actions performed in the `currentMap`


- - - 

## Map Scales 
- I want functionality that allows a `scale` value to determine the size of all the assets
